    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you like Piña Coladas and Mudslides, you’ll love this sweet and creamy concoction that falls somewhere between the two, essentially a boozy milkshake. Like its boozy siblings, it was invented at a Caribbean resort. Its creation is credited to bartender Angie Conigliaro at the Ship’s Store & Sapphire Pub on the island of St. Thomas in the USVI in 1975. It’s said to have been named for a patron’s dog.</p>
    <p>Shortly after, the owner of the Sandshaker Bar in Pensacola, Florida, visited the St. Thomas resort bar, where she fell in love with the Bushwacker and brought it back to her own bar, where it grew in fame. A version is now mass-produced in a bottled format by Bushwacker Spirits, and an annual festival celebrating the drink is held in Pensacola. </p>
